### Target

- Additional custom rules to increase the ability to detect and block advanced attacks that ML model has not caught.
- Combining Rate Limited, Geo-Blocking, and custom Rule (ReGEX, IPset, Header Anomaly) to minimize risks.
- Minimize False Positives, ensuring the system performance is not significantly affected.
